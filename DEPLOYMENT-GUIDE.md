## üì± Quick Start - 5 Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Create App Icons (2 options)

**Option A: Use Online Generator (Easiest)**

1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload a 512x512px logo
3. Download the generated icons
4. Extract and copy all PNG files to `public/icons/`

**Option B: Use ImageMagick Script**

```bash
# 1. Create a 512x512px logo file named 'app-logo.png' in project root
# 2. Install ImageMagick (if not installed)
sudo apt-get install imagemagick  # Ubuntu/Debian
# or
brew install imagemagick  # Mac

# 3. Make script executable and run
chmod +x generate-icons.sh
./generate-icons.sh
```

**Temporary Solution** (for testing):
The app includes a placeholder SVG icon. You can test without custom icons initially.

### Step 2: Build Your App

# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

**Method 3: GitHub Auto-Deploy**

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to https://netlify.com
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Select your repository
5. Build command: `npm run build`
6. Publish directory: `dist`

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### "Add to Home Screen" doesn't appear

- **Cause**: Not on HTTPS or manifest not found
- **Fix**: Deploy to Netlify (auto HTTPS) and verify manifest URL

### Service Worker fails to register

- **Cause**: Service worker path incorrect
- **Fix**: Ensure `service-worker.js` is in `public/` folder

### Icons don't display

- **Cause**: Icons missing or wrong sizes
- **Fix**: Generate all required sizes (72-512px)

### App doesn't work offline

- **Cause**: Service worker not installed yet
- **Fix**: Visit app once online, then test offline

### Geolocation doesn't work on iPhone

- **Cause**: iOS requires HTTPS for location
- **Fix**: Deploy to Netlify (has HTTPS) - already done!
