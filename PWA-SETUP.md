# 📱 PWA Setup Guide - Dryvupp

## What is a PWA?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web application that can be installed on devices like a native app. Users can add it to their home screen and use it offline!

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Generate App Icons

First, create your app logo:

- Create a **512x512px** PNG image of your app logo
- Save it as `app-logo.png` in the root directory

Then generate all required icon sizes:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x generate-icons.sh

# Run the icon generator
./generate-icons.sh
```

**OR** if you don't have ImageMagick, create icons manually:

- Use an online tool like [PWA Image Generator](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator)
- Upload your logo and download the generated icons
- Place them in `public/icons/` folder

Required sizes: 72, 96, 128, 144, 152, 192, 384, 512 pixels
