# Leaderboard & Points System Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive ranking system has been implemented that rewards users with points for reporting road issues. Users earn 5 points per issue reported, and their ranking is displayed on a dedicated leaderboard tab.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Points Service (`src/services/pointsService.js`)

**Functions:**

- `awardPointsForIssue(userId)` - Awards 5 points to a user for reporting an issue
- `getUserPoints(userId)` - Retrieves a user's current points and report count
- `getLeaderboard(limitCount)` - Fetches top users sorted by points

**Database Structure:**

- Collection: `userPoints`
- Fields:
  - `userId` - User's Firebase Auth ID
  - `points` - Total points accumulated
  - `issuesReported` - Number of issues reported
  - `createdAt` - Timestamp of first points earned
  - `lastUpdated` - Timestamp of last update

### 2. Leaderboard Component (`src/components/Leaderboard.jsx`)

**Features:**

### 4. Profile Stats Enhancement

- User's points refresh immediately after reporting
- Real-time update in profile stats

### 6. Privacy Controls

**Admin vs Regular Users:**

- Admins see:
  - All user display names
  - All user email addresses
  - Full leaderboard access
- Regular users see:
  - All user display names
  - Their own rank and stats
  - "You" badge on their entry
  - NO email addresses of other users

### 7. Styling

**New CSS Classes:**

- `.leaderboard-container` - Main wrapper
- `.leaderboard-header` - Title and subtitle section
- `.leaderboard-list` - Scrollable list of ranked users
- `.leaderboard-item` - Individual user row

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure

```
Firestore Collections:
├── userPoints/
│   └── {userId}/
│       ├── userId: string
│       ├── points: number
│       ├── issuesReported: number
│       ├── createdAt: timestamp
│       └── lastUpdated: timestamp
└── users/
    └── {userId}/
        ├── displayName: string
        ├── email: string
        └── role: string
```

### Integration Flow

1. User reports an issue via IssueReportModal
2. `handleIssueSubmit()` saves issue to Firestore
3. `awardPointsForIssue()` creates/updates userPoints document
4. User's points reload via `getUserPoints()`
5. Profile stats update automatically
6. Leaderboard reflects new points on next view

### Points Calculation

- Base: 5 points per issue
- No decay or expiration
- Cumulative system
- Future enhancement options:
  - Bonus points for severe issues
  - Multipliers for verified reports
  - Weekly/monthly challenges
  - Achievement badges

- User ID validation before awarding points
- Transaction safety with Firestore increment

**Future Enhancements:**

## Performance Notes

- Leaderboard limited to top 50 users for performance
- Real-time updates via Firestore listeners
- Efficient queries with indexed sorting
- Minimal data transfer with projection
- Cached user points in profile

## Known Limitations

1. Leaderboard shows top 50 only
2. No pagination for longer lists
3. Points cannot be removed (by design)
4. No point expiration
5. Display name required for ranking visibility

## Deployment Notes

- Ensure Firestore indexes exist:
  - Collection: `userPoints`
  - Fields: `points` (descending)
- Set up Firestore Security Rules:

  ```
  match /userPoints/{userId} {
    allow read: if request.auth != null;
    allow write: if false; // Only via Cloud Functions
  }
  ```

- Consider Cloud Functions for point awarding:
  - Prevents client-side manipulation
  - Adds validation layer
  - Enables complex business logic
  - Better security

## Summary

The leaderboard and points system is now fully functional. Users earn 5 points per issue reported, can view their rank on the dedicated Ranking tab, and see their points in their profile. Admins have full visibility including email addresses, while regular users see only display names for privacy. The system includes beautiful UI with medal icons for top 3, responsive design, and real-time updates.
